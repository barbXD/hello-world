# hello-world
I'm figuring out github don't mind me

# Hello I'm a newbie to both programming and github

## I've done some programming before starting using github but still in a very beginner level

I wish to improve my programming skills and be able to be **organized** with my projects using github
Also I hope I'm using *Markdown* correctly hahaha
